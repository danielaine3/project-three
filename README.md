```
2. Structure of the project
After you clone the reposity, navigate to the root directory (project-three). The project directory structure is set up as follows: 

* Server.js: This file:
    * Defines and requiers the dependencies, including express, body-parser, morgan logger, mongoose, passport
    * Sets up the Express server
    * Sets up the Express server to handle data parsing use body-parser
    * Sets up the logger
    * Sets up passport
    * Points the server to the API routes
    * Defines the port the server is listening on
    * Starts the server
    * Allows the app to serve static conten from the public directory

* models: Contains chapter.js, expense.js, index.js, needs.js and user.js files which contain the information for the application to set up the database

* controllers: Contains chaptersController.js, countryConroller.js, expenseController.js, needsController.js and usersController.js which contain the information fo the various pages for the application to interact with the database

* routes: Contains API folder and index.js file
    * API folder contains chapters.js, country.js, expense.js, index.js, needs.js and user.js files that sets up routers for each page
    * index.js file compiles all the routes for the app to use
    
* scripts: Contains the build.js, seedDB.js and start-client.js generated by create-react-app

* client: Containts public and src folders
    * public: Contains generated documents from create-react-app

3. Install front and backend dependencies. Whle in this directory, run the following command:
```
yarn installDeps
```






This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:
```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
```

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
